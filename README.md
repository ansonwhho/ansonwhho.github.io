# Spectroscopy Café
This is the repository for my personal blog, [Spectroscopy Café](spectroscopycafe.github.io), set up using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It features updates about my work, personal projects, expository writings etc.

The theme is [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) with edits to the default configuration. I've used [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for equations.
