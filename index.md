I'm a researcher at [Epoch](https://epochai.org/), where I combine tools and information across different fields to study AI progress and its societal impacts. 

I love learning many things, ranging from economics to physics. I'm also interested in making the world a better place, so I devote much of my time to working on important problems (or at least I think I do). 

Please feel free to reach out if you have thoughts about my work, my website, or if you'd just like to have a chat. You can reach me at anson dot ho dot work at gmail dot com.
