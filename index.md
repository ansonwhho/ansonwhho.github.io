I'm an AI forecasting researcher at [Epoch](https://epochai.org/). My research focus is on understanding the current AI landscape and modelling the development of advanced AI, with the goal of supporting efforts in technical AI safety, AI policy and AI governance.

I enjoy learning about lots of things, especially mathematics, physics, and language learning. I'm also interested in making the world a better place, so I devote much of my time to working on important problems (or at least I think I do).
