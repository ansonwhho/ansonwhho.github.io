I'm a researcher at [Epoch](https://epochai.org/) investigating and forecasting the development of advanced AI, with the goal of helping inform [AI governance](https://www.allandafoe.com/opportunity). My main research interests are in neural network interpretability, AI forecasting, and theoretical AI alignment. 

I love learning about lots of things, especially [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), rationality, maths, and physics. I also love language learning and playing the piano.
