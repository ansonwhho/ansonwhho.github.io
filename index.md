# **Anson Ho**
I'm a research intern working on [AI safety](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/), and a community builder for [Effective Altruism St Andrews](https://eastandrews.org). I'm passionate about mitigating [global risks](https://www.existential-risk.org/) from advanced technologies like [artificial intelligence](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment), and using [using reason and evidence to do social good](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/). 

Previously I was a physics student at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/), where I did my undergraduate thesis on optimising photonic crystal waveguides using neural networks.
