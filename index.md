I'm an AI forecasting researcher at [Epoch](https://epochai.org/), where I combine tools and information across different fields to understand the past, present, and future of AI. The goal of all this is to help the world prepare for the impacts of AI over the coming decades through policy and technical research.

I love learning a very wide range of things, such as languages, economics, and physics. I'm also interested in making the world a better place, so I devote much of my time to working on important problems (or at least I think I do).
