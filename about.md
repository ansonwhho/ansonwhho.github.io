# **Spectroscopy Café**
Spectroscopy Café is a personal blog where I share how I see the world. It mainly features updates about my work, personal projects and expository writings. 

You can find some of my other work on [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/u/spectroscopycafe), [GitHub](https://github.com/spectroscopycafe) and the [St Andrews Physics and Astronomy Magazine](https://pandamagazine.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/).

Hi! I'm Anson Ho, a student at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/). I'm passionate about helping to tackle [some of the world's most pressing questions](https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/) through [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/), particularly the [development and implications of artifical intelligence](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/). 

I recently completed my Bachelor's degree in physics, with an emphasis on numerical methods, electronics and condensed matter physics. My final year thesis was supervised by Dr Sebastian Schulz. This lay at the intersection between photonics and machine learning, developing a method to design optimised photonic crystal waveguides using neural networks. Currently I'm working on a summer research project with Prof Graham Turnbull, designing Monte Carlo based models to understand the high light capture efficiency of natural optical structures. 

I've been a member of [Effective Altruism St Andrews](https://www.facebook.com/EASaintAndrews/) and [One for the World St Andrews](https://www.facebook.com/OneForTheWorldStAndrews/) since September 2020.
