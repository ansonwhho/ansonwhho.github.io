I'm currently an independent researcher working on [AI safety](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/), and a community builder for [Effective Altruism St Andrews](https://eastandrews.org). In July 2021, I completed my Bachelor's degree in physics at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/).

My career goal is to help develop [safe and beneficial artificial intelligence](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment), both in terms of theoretical research and AI governance. I'm actively involved in the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) community - [using reason and evidence to do social good](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/). 

While I have many interests, I particularly enjoy mathematical physics, language learning, and playing the piano.
