# **Spectroscopy Café**
Spectroscopy Café is a personal blog where I share how I see the world through the lens of a physics student. It mainly features updates about my work, personal projects and expository writings. 

# **Anson Ho**
Hi! I'm Anson Ho, a final year undergraduate physics student at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/). I'm interested in all things physics and mathematics, and love learning about them just for the fun of it. My undergraduate thesis lies at the intersection between condensed matter and photonics, specifically Neural Networks to design Photonic Crystal Waveguides. 

Outside of my studies and immediate academic interests, I hope to help tackle [some of the world's most pressing questions](https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/) through [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/). 

I enjoy finding out just how little I know about the world, because this inspires me to learn more. Most of the time I do this through reading, but I sometimes also watch videos and listen to podcasts. Here is a selection of some of my favourite content: 

- [Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!)
- [The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Reality)
- [The 80,000 Hours Podcast with Rob Wiblin](https://80000hours.org/podcast/)
- [Philosophize This!](https://www.philosophizethis.org/)

You can find some of my other work on [Geogebra](https://spectroscopycafe.com/category/light-bites/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/spectroscopycafe).
