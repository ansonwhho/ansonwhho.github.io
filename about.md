# **Spectroscopy Café**
Spectroscopy Café is a personal blog featuring updates about my work, personal projects and expository writings. You can find more on [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/u/spectroscopycafe), [GitHub](https://github.com/spectroscopycafe) and the [St Andrews Physics and Astronomy Magazine](https://pandamagazine.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/).

Hi! I'm a physics student who is passionate about artificial intelligence and scientific research, as well as trying to tackle [some of the world's most pressing questions](https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/) through [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/). 

Currently I'm particularly interested in conducting research into the following areas: 
- Scientific applications of AI
- Reinforcement learning
- The mathematics of machine learning

### Background
Recently I completed my Bachelor's degree in physics at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/), with a strong emphasis on condensed matter, numerical and computational methods. My final year project focussed on developing a method to design optimised photonic crystal waveguides using neural networks. This was done as part of the [nanophotonics group](https://nanophotonics.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/) under the supervision of Dr Sebastian Schulz. 

At the moment I'm working on a summer research project with St Andrews' [organic semiconductor optoelectronics group](https://polyopto.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/) and [Heriot-Watt University](https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/organisations/school-of-energy-geoscience-infrastructure-and-society), supervised by Prof Graham Turnbull. Specifically, I'm helping to develop a Monte Carlo-based optical model and using machine learning imaging techniques to understand the high light capture efficiency of red coralline algae.

### Effective Altruism
There are many serious problems in the world, but only finite time and resources - the focus of [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/) is thus to figure out how to do the most good given what we have. 

I've been a member of [Effective Altruism St Andrews](https://www.facebook.com/EASaintAndrews/) and [One for the World St Andrews](https://www.facebook.com/OneForTheWorldStAndrews/) since September 2020. I also contributed to the writing of the data and information policy document for [Students for Global Health](https://studentsforglobalhealth.org/) UK. My main interest in EA is in these problem areas: 
- [The development and implications of AI](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/)
- [Science policy and infrastructure](https://www.eacambridge.org/improving-science)
- [Factory farming](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/)
