Previously I wrote a little bit about using intuition and qualitative understanding to solve physics problems, and how it can be very handy. That's certainly one way of looking at things; another perspective is that using physical understanding is just an excuse for glossing over important mathematics. 

I think a physics department isn't complete without a bit of [handwaving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-waving). This can sometimes be a bit of an issue, but for the most part actually think it's pretty useful. 

# It's a function
* Dirac Delta Function

# The series exists
* The Taylor Series always exists
    * Turn the perturbation off -- what??

# It's pretty much continuous
* Density of states

# It's negligible
* Near field

# It's basically a sphere
This is probably the canonical example of 
Seriously, is this the best joke we physicists can come up with?

# Orders of Magnitude
