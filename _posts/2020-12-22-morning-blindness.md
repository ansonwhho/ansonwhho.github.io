*What kinds of things might we be missing?*

<!--more-->

There is a brief period every morning where despite my eyes being open, I am practically blind. This starts from the moment when my alarm rings, and ends when I manage to find my glasses and put them on. A thirty second comedy where I am completely oblivious to my surroundings, unable to locate my phone, and at increased risk of tripping, every single day of the year.

One thing that I’ve learnt since starting university is that I’m really in this state of blindness all the time, regardless of whether my glasses are on or off, and whether I like it or not. What I mean by this is that there is just so much that I cannot see even in my waking life, and that this could have heavy ramifications.

Consider, for example, that there is an entire world that we are completely invisible to and yet lies right in front of our eyes. The minuscule particles in perpetual random motion all around us. We humans have even been sensing it every day of our lives since the dawn of civilisation through temperature, but it [wasn’t until the 1800s](https://www.britannica.com/science/Brownian-motion) that we were really able to see what was happening on a small scale.

Another example that comes to my mind is light lying outside the visible range. I remember looking at my IGCSE textbook and finding out that everything that I could see, and had ever seen, came from this narrow slit on the full electromagnetic spectrum. Nowadays we regularly make use of different invisible wavelengths of light for electronics and communications, so it’s easy to forget that it was only in [1800 when William Herschel first discovered infrared radiation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13682199.2000.11784339).

Paying attention to these things has brought about quite remarkable advances in science and technology. Being able to see and even manipulate the structures of molecules has allowed the development of transistors, and I certainly wouldn’t be typing these words onto my computer without them. Astronomers are even able to determine elemental compositions of stars that we may never reach, just by deciphering the chemical fingerprints from stellar spectra.

To me, as a physics student, these are the most obvious examples of “what we cannot see”. But studying at university has also introduced me to a second kind of “not being able to see” – one that is not just due to the physical limitations of our senses.

One thing that comes to mind is the diverse set of backgrounds that people come from. Back in school, I was mostly confined to an insulated bubble of friends from similar walks of life, and the world seemed so small. I’ve now come to realise that it’s not quite such a small world after all. People come from different backgrounds and each person has their own story to tell. I hadn’t seen that this was the case, because I had not experienced anything beyond my daily robotic rituals at school.

I think that there also many things that societies can collectively be blind to. This is perhaps well illustrated by the many moral atrocities of the past, that we now look back on with disdain. [Slavery was an extremely common practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery), and even some of the greatest philosophers of the past have been [accused of conjuring unfounded justifications for it](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/notes.html). Nowadays it is widely condemned and [mostly abolished](https://www.cfr.org/blog/human-trafficking-and-slavery-21st-century), but it leaves me wondering what abhorrent, immoral actions we might be committing. A strong candidate for this is our [annual slaughter of billions of farmed land animals](https://faunalytics.org/global-animal-slaughter-statistics-and-charts-2020-update/), and its associated [impacts on climate](https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/tackling-worlds-most-urgent-problem-meat) and [zoonotic diseases](https://www.hse.gov.uk/agriculture/topics/zoonoses.htm). Is this morally permissible? I’m not sure, and I find it very plausible that our descendants will see this in the same way that we view slavery today.

How utterly primitive and barbaric must we seem to the people of the future? *“The 21st century must have been horrible. Imagine getting from place to place by car, how awful!”* For me, a takeaway from all this is that I really am stumbling around the world without glasses on. Or perhaps, my view is just heavily distorted, as if I were looking at things with a kaleidoscope rather than spectacles.

So, what’s the point of this rambling? I think that it hints towards the importance of seeing as much as possible, to realise that there may be so much out there that could be invisible to me, and that perhaps I ought to consider LASIK surgery. To a certain extent it’s a little unsettling to think that I’m probably a moral criminal some way or another, and that on the grand scheme of things I’m absolutely clueless. But on the other hand, I think that just gives me all the more reason to try and learn as much as I can about the world.
