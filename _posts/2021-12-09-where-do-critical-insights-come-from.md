 **Epistemic status**: low confidence, exploratory. I don't really know what I'm talking about here, and I don't do history of science in any professional capacity. This is mostly just to satisfy my interests!

 <br />

This is partially inspired by the technological discontinuity investigation by AI Impacts. I think this post is more general in its scope and also in much less depth. 

Focussing on where critical insights came from in STEM fields. I know much less about the humanities, arts, etc. I'm not even sure if "critical insights" is even an apt description of a "cause of progress" in these other domains. If you do know more about these areas, please share your thoughts!

Most of these are just based off thoughts from the top of my head. Take them with a grain of salt!

## Definitions
* Critical insight: crucial for moving forward
* Jump: wouldn't have expected such a discovery for maybe a decade (maybe a better operationalisation is researcher-hours)
    * e.g. could argue that Special Relativity "was coming anyway", but Einstein sped it up

## List
* Ideas from another field
    * Person moves in from another field - how far afield?
        * Near: Fermat's Last Theorem
        * Far: ?
    * Researchers steal ideas from another field
    * This reminds me a bit of an "overhang"
* Black box leaps of ingenuity
    * e.g. Ramanujan
    * Black box - nobody really understands how they came to their conclusions
* Random discoveries
    * e.g. discovery of penicillin
* Not-so-random discoveries - "critical mass"?
    * e.g. Lightbulb
    * Lots of people thinking really hard
    * Tons of investment in R&D
* Low-hanging fruit
    * 
* Missed low-hanging fruit
    * e.g. matrix multiplication method - see 3b1b

## What might this imply? 
Seems like we might have contrasting factors - low hanging fruit vs the others. Will we hit diminishing returns?

* For AI safety
* For other X-risks
* For other areas in EA

Not sure!

Other fields
* Someone rights a key essay? e.g. Keynes' telegram
* Perhaps the analogous thing to look at is social movements?
