**Epistemic status**: moderate confidence, likely a few mistakes or misconceptions.

*Lately I've been trying to upskill in deep learning, and as such I've been doing a ton of reading about different neural network architectures. This has involved quite a lot of implementation-level understanding of the mechanisms of neural networks, but I think texts tend to focus a bit less on the high-level picture of things. This is me trying to clarify things in my own head, so that I can get a better sense of how things interrelate.*
